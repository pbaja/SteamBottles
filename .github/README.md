# What is SteamJar
SteamJar is a tool that helps you add all of your non-steam games to Steam.  
It will search for games from all supported game launchers from all known sources (Bottles, Wineprefixes) and add them as a non-steam applications.
Additionally - when missing pictures are detected, this tool will download them from SteamGridDB if you wish.

## Roadmap
Things to do, sorted by priority.  
- Add simpler installation method
- Adding games from Origin
- Check if running games from EGS directly works / works better
- Check if running games from UbiConnect directly works / works better
- Code cleanup and documentation (types)
- Ability to edit shortcuts
- Ability to change images when editing
- Tests
- Juicify GUI - icons, tooltips, padding
- Adding standalone games
- Backing up your shortcuts, multiple sets?

### Extra
There are two commandline options:
 - `--cli` - Forces the use of a CLI interface
 - `--gui` - Forces the use of a GUI interface. It will fall back to CLI if GUI fails.
